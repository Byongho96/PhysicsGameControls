		<p>
			We provide controller APIs designed for major device scenarios. However, you can also create  
			custom controls tailored to your preferred device. This is achieved using multiple inheritance through Mixins. 	
		</p>

		<p>
			Below is an example of how `FPKeyboardControls`, which supports both keyboard and mouse drag operations, is created.
		</p>

		<h2>Example: FPKeyboardDragControls</h2>

		<ul>
				<li>[link:https://github.com/Byongho96/three-game-controls/blob/master/src/mixins/KeyboardMixin.ts KeyboardMixin]</li>
				<li>[link:https://github.com/Byongho96/three-game-controls/blob/master/src/mixins/DragMixin.ts DragMixin]</li>
		</ul>

		<code>
		import { FirstPersonControls, KeyboardMixin, DragMixin } from 'three-game-controls';

		class FPKeyboardDragControls extends KeyboardMixin( DragMixin( FirstPersonControls ) ) {}

		export { FPKeyboardDragControls };
		</code>

		<p>
			By combining the Mixins we provide, or by writing your own Mixins, you can customize controls to meet your needs.
