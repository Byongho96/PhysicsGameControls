    <p>
			Three Game Controls provides game controls built on top of [link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/code three.js]. 
			It features essential physics engine capabilities, such as <strong>gravity and collision detection</strong>, making it lightweight and suitable for use in web environments.
			It also supports interaction with <strong>various input devices</strong>, such as mouse, keyboard, and touch
    </p>

		<h2>Motivation</h2>

		<p>
			With the advancement of WebGL technology, 3D experiences on the web are becoming increasingly common. However, creating realistic virtual worlds remains a cumbersome task. 
			Three Game Controls aims to minimize boilerplate code and provide a simple controller API that <strong>allows characters to explore immersive worlds</strong> using only the three.js codebase.	
		</p>
	
		<p>
			Three Game Controls will likely:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Lightweight:</strong><br/>
					Focuses on core physics features like gravity and collision detection, ensuring high performance in the web environment.<br/>
					(If you require more detailed physics capabilities, consider other options.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Customizable:</strong><br/>
					Supports a wide range of device I/O combinations to control characters. In addition to the default controls we provide, you can create your own controllers using Mixins.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Animation Management:</strong><br/>
					The third-person controller automatically plays appropriate animations based on the current velocity. Developers can also customize animation clip sources as needed.
			</ul>

    <p>
      Although the name is "Game Controls", <strong>it is not limited to games</strong>. Use it to make your services, products, or ideas more captivating in 3D spaces.
